Heart Disease Prediction using ANN 
This dataset is the Statlog Heart Disease dataset taken from UCI Repository. This dataset contains of 270 individuals' data. There are 14 columns in the dataset which has no missing values.  
This database contains 13 attributes and a target variable. It has 8 nominal values and 5 numeric values. The detailed description of all these attributes are as follows: 
Age: Patients Age in years (Numeric)
Sex: Gender (Male : 1; Female : 0) (Nominal)
cp: Type of chest pain experienced by patient. This term categorized into 4 category.
0 typical angina, 1 atypical angina, 2 non- anginal pain, 3 asymptomatic (Nominal)
trestbps: patient's level of blood pressure at resting mode in mm/HG (Numerical)
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl (Numeric)
fbs: Blood sugar levels on fasting > 120 mg/dl represents as 1 in case of true and 0 as false (Nominal)
restecg: Result of electrocardiogram while at rest are represented in 3 distinct values
0 : Normal 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of >
0.05 mV) 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophyby Estes' criteria (Nominal)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric)
exang: Angina induced by exercise 0 depicting NO 1 depicting Yes (Nominal)
oldpeak: Exercise induced ST-depression in relative with the state of rest (Numeric)
slope: ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise
0: up sloping; 1: flat; 2: down sloping(Nominal)
ca: The number of major vessels (0–3)(nominal)
thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia
0: NULL 1: normal blood flow 2: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart) 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal(nominal)
target: It is the target variable which we have to predict 1 means patient is suffering from heart disease and 0 means patient is normal.

This models predicts the Absence(0) or Presence(1) of the heart disease
